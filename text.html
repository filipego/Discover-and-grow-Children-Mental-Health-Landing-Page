        <h2 class="heading-2">The 5 most important things you can do to help your children adjust to a new normal.</h2>

        <p>
            The effects of COVID through social isolation, the loss of loved ones, and the uncertainty of the future have had profound effects on the social and emotional well being and overall mental health of people worldwide including our children and youth. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As a parent there are many things we can do. Here's a list of 5 very important, and not so hard things we can focus on to help our children get through this new phase in their lives.
        </p>


        <h2 class="heading-2">1. Love them no matter what: It takes patience and effort</h2>

        <p>
            There is no doubt that as parents we love our children endlessly. Think about that warm fuzzy feeling when you observe your child peacefully sleep. Unfortunately that feeling sometimes seems to disappear and get replaced with anger, fear or anxiety to which we react in a way that may tell our kids a different story about how much we love them. So to start, we are going to need patience, effort and a whole lot of deep breaths.
        </p>

        <p>
            Think about instances in your life in which you may be contributing to your children's stress levels and even self-deprecation. For example, when you are having a tough time getting out of the house on time in the morning, do you feel like the only way to make things better is to yell? How about when you've told your child for the 100th time not to do something because it is unsafe and they still manage to do it again. How do you react, are hurtful words your go-to? How about when you caught your teenager smoking? Do you show them your disappointment by ignoring them and withholding your love?  I understand, being a parent is not easy, we all have a limit and we can't always react in a loving and patient way. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Now remember we are here to help our children through this tough time and one way to do so is to make sure they know we love them unconditionally. <span> When children know they are truly loved, it helps them grow up to be more peaceful and confident adults</span>. 
        </p>


        <h3 class="heading-3">Here's what I'd like you to do before reacting to the next “situation”:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Identify your body sensations: Is your heart racing? Is your blood boiling?</li>
            <li>What are you thinking about? Are you already thinking about how you are going to punish them? Or are you trying to put yourself in their shoes?</li>
            <li>Breath in (count to 3), Breath out (count to 3). Repeat this step as many times as necessary and until your body sensations and thoughts have dissipated.</li>
            <li>Now that the internal storm has passed you can react in a loving, purposeful, and mature way and proceed to discipline them according to their actions.</li>
        </ul>




        <h2 class="heading-2">2. Be there for them: Practice your active listening skills.</h2>

        <p>
            What does it mean to be there? It means to be present. To let them know they have your full attention and they can count on your understanding and love no matter what. It is tough being present most of the time, we get so caught up trying to get through our to-do's that we sometimes neglect the things and people that really matter. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I'd like you to stop for a moment and rethink your priorities. What really matters in your life? Write them down. I'm pretty sure the emotional and mental well being of your child is on that list. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">Here's a way to let your children know you are present:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Stop. When your children come to you to say something, stop whatever you are doing. Even if you think they are just saying something in passing</li>
            <li>Turn to them and look at them. Communication takes place mostly through body language. So make sure your body is telling your children you are paying attention.</li>
            <li>Listen and repeat or clarify what they said. Sometimes all we need is an open ear. As parents we tend to default to providing advice right away. Depending on the conversation, you can choose to just listen and provide understanding comments or if necessary give advice.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="heading-2">3. Observe their behavior</h2>

        <p>
            This is particularly important as sometimes our children won't come to us and tell us what is bothering them. However, they will show something is off through their behavior. So be sure to pay attention. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">Look out for:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Change of habits. Have they stopped doing things that they used to love?</li>
            <li>How's their behavior? Are they more withdrawn? Lonely?</li>
            <li>What are they saying? Do they sound hopeless?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Go with your gut and don't disregard any of these signs as they can make a difference in identifying depression, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts.
        </p>


        <h2 class="heading-2">4. Model behavior: Breath, Journal, Self-care.</h2>

        <p>
            I know you know this but here's a reminder, "your children are watching". You are their biggest role-model and you want to make sure you model the right behavior for them. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Even when society puts too much emphasis on success and working hard to achieve it, we need to make sure we show our children that success should not come at the expense of neglecting ourselves. It is extremely important that you model a balanced lifestyle through self-care and other proper behavior while also encouraging and giving them the opportunity to implement it in their lives. 
        </p>


        <h3 class="heading-3">Here are some positive behaviors we recommend you inspire in your children through modeling and encouragement:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Take deep breaths:</span> When you are practicing deep breathing, let your child know what you are doing and why. At the same time, encourage them to do it themselves preferably before an emotional explosion. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Eat healthy:</span> Having balanced meals and staying away from oily or sugary foods, does not only affect our physical health, but also our mood.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Exercise:</span> Similar to eating, healthy exercise not only helps us stay in good physical shape, but can also help us control our anger and release negative energy produced by it.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Journal:</span> This is a great way to help you realize what’s happening, to release your feelings and thoughts, and to learn from your experiences. I highly recommend journaling.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Model good qualities:</span> Honesty, patience and perseverance are just a few of the qualities that our children observe and model from us. So next time you lie, give up on something right away or blow up with anger in front of them, know that you are teaching these behaviors to them. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Read, paint, do something you enjoy:</span> Last, but not least, in order to teach your kids to enjoy the pleasures of life make sure you are doing so yourself. Do things you enjoy such as reading a good book, eating a great meal, or being creative through art, music, or writing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-2">5. Get support: You are not alone</h2>

        <p>
            It is not easy being a parent. We are constantly double guessing ourselves, wondering whether we are doing things right. Don't get discouraged, you are not alone and best of all you are on the right path, you are trying to be better for your children! If you weren't trying you wouldn't be reading this article.
        </p>
