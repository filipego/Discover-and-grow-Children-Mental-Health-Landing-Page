        <section class="article-content">
            <h2 class="heading-2">1. Let your children know you love them unconditionally</h2>

            <p>There is no doubt that as parents you love our children no matter what. Think about that warm fuzzy feeling you get when you observe your child peacefully sleep, laugh, achieve a new milestone or simply do something that is very unique to them. They just bring a smile out of you.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, life's demand and expectations can bring out a lot of opposite and negative emotions, specially in parents trying to juggle their own lives and dreams with that of their children. At times that warm, fuzzy, loving feeling towards our children gets pushed aside and seems to get temporarily replaced with anger, fear or anxiety to which we are then prone to reacting in a not so loving manner leaving our children both hurt and confused. </p>

            <p>With the new normal COVID has forced upon us, feelings and emotions can be magnified at any given moment for both parents and children. As a consequence, unimportant situations can seem to be a greater deal than in fact they are, leading us to extreme overreactions.</p>

            <p>It is for this reason that <span class="bold">we've placed love and patience at the top of our tips for parents determined to help their children adjust to the new normal</span>.</p>

            <p>Think about instances in your life in which you may be affecting your children's mental health care in a negative manner? </p>

            <ul>
                <li>When you are having a tough time getting out of the house on time in the morning, do you feel like the only way to make things better is to yell? </li>
                <li>How about when you've told your child for the 100th time not to do something because it is unsafe and they still manage to do it again. How do you react, are hurtful words your go-to? </li>
                <li>How about when you caught your teenager smoking? Do you show them your disappointment by ignoring them and withholding your love?  </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I understand. You are not alone. Being a parent is not easy. We all have a limit and we can't always react in a loving and patient way. </p>

            <p>Now remember, our goal is to help our children adjust to the new normal while improving their mental health care.</p>

            <p>One way to do so is to make sure they know you love them unconditionally. <span class="bold">When children know they are loved no matter what, it helps them grow up to be more peaceful and confident adults</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-3">Here are some tips for parents before reacting to the next “situation”:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Identify your body sensations: Is your heart racing? Is your blood boiling?</li>
                <li>What are you thinking about? Are you already thinking about how you are going to punish them? Or are you trying to put yourself in their shoes? </li>
                <li>Breath in (count to 3), Breath out (count to 3). Repeat this step as many times as necessary and until your body sensations and thoughts have dissipated. </li>
                <li>Now that the internal storm has passed you can react in a loving, purposeful, and mature way and proceed to discipline your children according to their actions.</li>
            </ol>

        <section class="article-content">
            <h2 class="heading-2">2. Be present for your children: Practice active listening </h2>

            <p>What does it mean to be present? It means to let your children know they have your full attention and can count on your understanding and love no matter what. </p>

            <p>It is tough being present all the time, we get so caught up trying to get through our to-do's that we sometimes neglect the things and people that really matter. </p>

            <p>One way to get out of this habit is through rethinking our priorities. What really matters in our life? Write them down. I'm pretty sure the emotional and mental health care of your child is on that list. </p>

            <h3 class="heading-3">Here are some tips for parents to let your children know you are present:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Stop</span>. When your children come to you to say something, stop whatever you are doing. Even if you think they are just saying something in passing. </li>
                <li>Turn to them and <span class="bold">make eye contact</span>. Communication takes place mostly through body language. So make sure your body is telling your children you are paying attention.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Listen</span> and repeat or clarify what they said. Sometimes all we need is an open ear. As parents we tend to default to providing advice right away. Depending on the conversation, you can choose to just listen and provide understanding comments or if necessary give advice.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="article-content">
            <h2 class="heading-2">3. Pay attention to changes in your children's behavior </h2>

            <p>When it comes to mental health care, this point is particularly important as sometimes our children won't come to us and tell us what is bothering them. However, they will show something is off through their behavior.  </p>

            <p class="bold">So be sure to pay attention. </p>

            <h3 class="heading-3">Among our tips for parents in this area are:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Look out for change in habits.</span> Have they stopped doing things that they used to love?  
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">How's their behavior?</span> Are they more withdrawn? Lonely?</li>
                <li><span class="bold">What are they saying?</span> Do they sound hopeless? </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Go with your gut and don't disregard any of these signs as they can make a difference in identifying depression, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts.</p>

        <section class="article-content">
            <h2 class="heading-2">4. Model the right behavior: Breath, Journal, Self-care</h2>

            <p>WI know you know this but here's a reminder, “your children are watching”. You are their biggest role-model and you want to make sure you model the right behavior for their mental health care.</p>

            <p>Even when society puts too much emphasis on success and working hard to achieve it, we need to make sure we show our children that success should not come at the expense of neglecting ourselves. It is extremely important that you model a balanced lifestyle through self-care and other proper behavior while also encouraging and giving them the opportunity to implement it in their lives. </p>

            <h3 class="heading-3">Here are some tips for parents focused in positive behaviors we recommend you inspire in your children through modeling and encouragement in order to improve their mental health care:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Take deep breaths:</span> When you are practicing deep breathing, let your child know what you are doing and why. At the same time, encourage them to do it themselves preferably before an emotional explosion. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Eat healthy:</span> Having balanced meals and staying away from oily or sugary foods, does not only affect our physical health, but also our mood. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Exercise:</span> Similar to eating, healthy exercise not only helps us stay in good physical shape, but can also help us control our anger and release negative energy produced by it.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Journal:</span> This is a great way to help you realize what's happening, to release your feelings and thoughts, and to learn from your experiences. I highly recommend journaling.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Model good qualities:</span> Honesty, patience and perseverance are just a few of the qualities that our children observe and model from us. So next time you lie, give up on something right away or blow up with anger in front of them, know that you are teaching these behaviors to them. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Read, paint, do something you enjoy:</span> Last, but not least, in order to teach your kids to enjoy the pleasures of life and take focus away from all the negative make sure you are doing so yourself. Do things you enjoy such as reading a good book, eating a great meal, or being creative through art, music, or writing.</li>
            </ul>
