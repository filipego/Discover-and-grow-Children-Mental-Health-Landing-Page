            <h2 class="heading-2">1. Let your children know you love them unconditionally</h2>

            <p>There is no doubt that as parents you love our children no matter what. Think about that warm fuzzy feeling you get when you observe your child peacefully sleep, laugh, achieve a new milestone or simply do something that is very unique to them. They just bring a smile out of you.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, life's demand and expectations can bring out a lot of opposite and negative emotions, specially in parents trying to juggle their own lives and dreams with that of their children. At times that warm, fuzzy, loving feeling towards our children gets pushed aside and seems to get temporarily replaced with anger, fear or anxiety to which we are then prone to reacting in a not so loving manner leaving our children both hurt and confused. </p>

            <p>With the new normal COVID has forced upon us, feelings and emotions can be magnified at any given moment for both parents and children. As a consequence, unimportant situations can seem to be a greater deal than in fact they are, leading us to extreme overreactions.</p>

            <p>It is for this reason that <span class="bold">we've placed love and patience at the top of our tips for parents determined to help their children adjust to the new normal</span>.</p>

            <p>Think about instances in your life in which you may be affecting your children's mental health care in a negative manner? </p>

            <ul>
                <li>When you are having a tough time getting out of the house on time in the morning, do you feel like the only way to make things better is to yell? </li>
                <li>How about when you've told your child for the 100th time not to do something because it is unsafe and they still manage to do it again. How do you react, are hurtful words your go-to? </li>
                <li>How about when you caught your teenager smoking? Do you show them your disappointment by ignoring them and withholding your love?  </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I understand. You are not alone. Being a parent is not easy. We all have a limit and we can't always react in a loving and patient way. </p>

            <p>Now remember, our goal is to help our children adjust to the new normal while improving their mental health care.</p>

            <p>One way to do so is to make sure they know you love them unconditionally. <span class="bold">When children know they are loved no matter what, it helps them grow up to be more peaceful and confident adults</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-3">Here are some tips for parents before reacting to the next “situation”:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Identify your body sensations: Is your heart racing? Is your blood boiling?</li>
                <li>What are you thinking about? Are you already thinking about how you are going to punish them? Or are you trying to put yourself in their shoes? </li>
                <li>Breath in (count to 3), Breath out (count to 3). Repeat this step as many times as necessary and until your body sensations and thoughts have dissipated. </li>
                <li>Now that the internal storm has passed you can react in a loving, purposeful, and mature way and proceed to discipline your children according to their actions.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="heading-2">2. Be present for your children: Practice active listening. </h2>

            <p>What does it mean to be present? It means to let your children know they have your full attention and can count on your understanding and love no matter what. </p>

            <p>It is tough being present all the time, we get so caught up trying to get through our to-do's that we sometimes neglect the things and people that really matter. </p>

            <p>One way to get out of this habit is through rethinking our priorities. What really matters in our life? Write them down. I'm pretty sure the emotional and mental health care of your child is on that list. </p>
